ACDemos - Application Craft Demos
===

Each application in this repository will demonstrate certain features of the Application Craft's online, cloud-based IDE.  Each app's goal is to provide a simple example of a single -- or small group of -- AC IDE features. In many of the examples I'll incorporate other libraries or projects such as jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and PhoneGap.  These apps are by no means perfect and are available for you to improve upon, learn from, and take apart.  If you find a bit of code that is incorrect, or not working for you, please let me know and I can take a look.  

Of course, if you find a better way to code something in one of the demos, please let me know. I'm *always* open to learning how to improve upon my code.

### WidgetTest1:

    Examples of-

        jQuery:
            fadeOut()
            fadeIn()
            animate()
            animation easing ('in' and 'out', 32 possible values for each)

        AC IDE:
            getValue()
            setValue()
            getProperty()
            setProperty()
            WYSIWYG Editor (for short paragraph of instructions)
